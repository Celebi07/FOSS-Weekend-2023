## Instructions

- Create a pull request for the issues and/or instructions highlighted in the readme of the following projects. 
- Try to complete the `must do` tasks before you move further, because they will give you a very good foundational knowledge about git by visiting the repositories, and looking through the issues. 
- The issues are tagged *easy*, to *hard* depending on difficulty. 
- You should try to start by trying to solve the easy issues before progressing to the harder ones.
- View the leaderboard at [https://foss.pranavg.me](https://foss.pranavg.me/) (Leaderboard will be active once the event starts)


### Special Instructions for `to-be-assigned` labelled issues:
- If the issue has a `to-be-assigned` label, ask for the issue to be assigned to you, and start working on it only after you recieve confirmation that you have been assigned. These issues will be assigned only to 3 participants on a first come first serve basis, and each of them will have to submit a PR fixing it within 3 hours from the time of assignment. 

- Out of these 3 PRs, all satisfactory ones will be scored, and 1 or 2 may get a bonus for exceptional work. If all the PRs have roughly the same quality of content, the earliest submission may get a bonus. Bonus scores are at the discretion of the event organizers. 

- If you realise after getting yourself assigned an issue, that you cannot work on it due to any reason, be sure to unassign yourself, to give a chance to others who may want to work on the issue. Also leave a comment informing everyone that this issue is again open to assignment.

## Good practices (must read before starting)
- **Write clear and concise pull request descriptions**: Explain the changes you made, and how they impact the project. You may add a SS, gif or a small video of your changes made if possible.
- **Mention issue numbers**: When creating a PR, [reference the issue number](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (for eg: `fixes #123`) in your PR description which lets github know to automatically close the issue when your PR is merged.
- **Use descriptive and concise commit messages**: Summarize the changes made in each commit, including the issue number if applicable.
- **Create separate branches for new features**: create a new branch from main/master for each new features or bug fixes you are working on.
- **Regularly merge from the main branch**: To keep your branches up-to-date, regularly merge changes from the main branch into your feature branches.
